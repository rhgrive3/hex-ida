/**
 * Control-flow structuring facts, with every edge accounted for.
 *
 * The claim a structurer has to be able to make is not "this function became a
 * tidy while loop". It is: *every edge in the original CFG is still there*, and
 * for each one you can say what became of it — a structured construct, an
 * explicit jump, or an explicit unknown. An edge that appears in none of those
 * three answers has been lost, and a lost edge is a path through the program the
 * reader will never see.
 *
 * So this pass is built around the accounting rather than around the prettiness.
 * It reads the canonical CFG, dominance, post-dominance and the P8-4 loop facts,
 * classifies each edge, and publishes the classification together with the
 * regions it implies. `lostCfgEdgeCount` is then a number a verifier can
 * recompute from the CFG alone, which is the point: the pass does not get to
 * mark its own work.
 *
 * Three rules follow from that.
 *
 * `gotoCount = 0` is not a goal and is not a gate. A correct `goto` beats a
 * false `while` every time, so an edge that cannot be structured safely is
 * accounted as a residual jump and left alone.
 *
 * An edge whose kind this pass does not recognise — an unwind edge, an indirect
 * candidate, anything a later phase adds — is never quietly folded into a
 * structured construct. It becomes an explicit constraint on the region that
 * contains it.
 *
 * A region is not split to make it structurable unless duplicating it is
 * provably free of observable effects, and even then this checkpoint only
 * publishes the candidate. Duplicating a call or a store to tidy a diamond is
 * the merge blocker this pass exists to avoid.
