/**
 * Phase 8 vertical runner.
 *
 * This is the one place Phase 8 passes are executed and published. Passes never
 * write to the decompiler state themselves: they return results, and this runner
 * publishes them as a single frozen ledger or publishes nothing at all.
 *
 * Publication is all-or-nothing on purpose. The current `PassManager` merges each
 * pass's return value into shared state as it goes, which is fine for the
 * representation passes it was written for but is exactly how a cancelled or
 * failed optimizer leaves half-transformed facts behind (PHASE8_CHECKPOINT_CONTRACTS
 * P8-1 merge blockers). P8-0 establishes the boundary with one identity pass;
 * P8-1 extends the same boundary to staged IR/AST mutation.
 *
 * The published ledger is deterministic: identical input and identical registry
 * produce an identical `publicationDigest`. Wall-clock timings are reported
 * beside it and are deliberately not part of the digest.
