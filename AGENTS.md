## Engineering process safety

For any master-phase, component-lane, living-integration, release/cutover, generated-output, ownership/governance, CI, moving-main reconciliation, Dev Supervisor, or iOS/browser automation work, read `docs/ENGINEERING_PROCESS_GUARDRAILS.md` before acting.

Its `MUST` / `MUST NOT` rules are merge-blocking. Do not replace an exact-head, candidate-merge-tree, generated-output, independent-verifier, active-runtime, or target-device requirement with a weaker proxy. A repeated process failure must gain a permanent automated regression where technically possible. A phase is not done until the applicable completion checklist in that document is satisfied.

## Low-token test execution

When an agent needs a broad test or release-gate run, suppress successful chatter instead of sending thousands of passing lines back into model context.

- Full repository gate: `node scripts/run-quiet-command.mjs --label check -- npm run check`
- Full regression chain: `node scripts/run-quiet-command.mjs --label test -- npm test`
- Shared Phase 8–10 runners are quiet by default; use the whole-command wrapper for other broad suites.
- A successful quiet run prints only its bounded summary. A failed whole-command run prints a bounded failure tail and retains the complete local log path.
- For diagnosis, rerun the smallest failing command with `HEX_TEST_OUTPUT=verbose` to restore full output.
- Do not replace the canonical `npm run check`, verifier, denominator, exact-head, or release semantics. Quiet execution changes presentation only, never what is tested.

## Graft — repo context graph

### Environment gate — GitHub Codespaces only

The Graft workflow in this section applies **only** when the task is running inside GitHub Codespaces.

- **Inside GitHub Codespaces:** use Graft first for repository context as described below. If Graft is unexpectedly unavailable, continue with the normal repository tools available in that Codespace rather than blocking the task.
- **Outside GitHub Codespaces:** do **not** install, invoke, emulate, or require Graft. Do not treat Graft's absence as a blocker. Use the repository inspection/search tools available in the current environment instead.

This repo is indexed in `graft/`: small linked markdown nodes that explain each
system and carry exact file:line spans, kept in sync with the code through git.

When running inside GitHub Codespaces, for ANY task here — understanding how something works, finding where code lives,
or scoping a change — get context from the graph before grepping or opening
source files. Re-ask freely (it's cheap) and reuse literal identifiers you
already have (symbol, error string, file name) as the query. New to this repo?
Run `graft map` first — a token-budgeted orientation (dir clusters, hubs,
hotspots), no LLM, no key.

- Run `graft ask "<your question>" --source` → ranked nodes with the relevant
  code spans inlined (each hit's ≤8-line crux by default; `--full` for whole
  definitions when the crux isn't enough). Match the tool to the task shape:
  for understanding or editing, the top node IS the answer — cite its
  `covers:` file:line spans and edit straight from `--source`. For
  exhaustive tasks ("every occurrence / every caller of this pattern"), ranked
  results are top-N, not complete — run `graft grep "<literal>"` instead
  (exhaustive over indexed files, grouped by enclosing symbol), falling back
  to raw `grep -rn` only for unindexed files.
- `graft skeleton <file>` → every definition's signature + span, ~10× cheaper
  than reading the file; use it to skim an API surface.
- `graft callers <symbol>` gives precomputed, exact edges — who calls this.
  Add `--direction out` for what it calls, or `--depth N` to walk
  transitively for the full blast radius. For structural questions, skip
  ranking and use this directly.
- Or browse: `graft/INDEX.md` lists every node; follow the links.
- Monorepos and folders of multiple repos rank fairly across sub-projects —
  hits carry `[scope/]` labels naming which one they're from. Narrow with
  `graft ask "<task>" --in <scope>/` once you know where you're working.

If a returned span is truncated ("+N more lines"), open the file at that exact
range before finalizing. Only open source files when a node genuinely lacks a
needed detail, and then at the exact file:line the node points to — never
re-read whole files.

After big code changes, refresh the graph with `graft build` (deterministic,
no API key, $0).
