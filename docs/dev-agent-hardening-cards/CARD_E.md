# CARD E — Separate explicit task deadlines from default model-turn waiting

**Purpose:** stop treating a generic default wall clock as proof that a model turn stalled.  
**Expected difficulty:** 4–5/10.

## ALLOWED FILES

CARD: E
BRANCH: dev-agent-hardening/e-explicit-deadlines

PRECONDITION
CARD C is merged/present and Graph long-turn completion is Promise-driven.

MISSION
Change task timeout representation so a normal model turn has no generic default timeout, while an explicitly supplied timeoutMs remains a real caller-owned deadline. Preserve quiescent ownership: cancellation/deadline does not make a Worker reusable until owned work is known stopped/settled or the iframe is retired through the existing discard path.

ALLOWED FILES
- js/userscript/dev/task-graph/dynamic-task-graph.js
- tests/dev-agent/dynamic-task-graph.mjs

DO NOT
- build Phase-5 liveness or stall heuristics
- add ACTIVE/QUIET/SUSPECTED_STALL state machines
- modify Pool waitResult
- modify public tools
- add progress polling
- modify retry/dependency semantics
- treat AbortController.abort() as proof that the Worker is already quiescent/reusable

TARGET CONTRACT
- timeoutMs omitted/null => no generic model-turn deadline
- timeoutMs = finite N => explicit deadline bounded by the existing maximum policy
- public task/status output may expose null for no deadline

ERROR SEMANTICS
- graph-wide/user cancellation => cancelled
- the task's explicit deadline expiry => task-timeout
Do not collapse these into one error merely because both may use AbortController internally.

QUIESCENT OWNERSHIP
For any cancellation/deadline path:
1. issue the existing cancellation/stop request;
2. keep the current lease/attempt as owner while the started work settles or stop is confirmed;
3. release only after safe quiescence under the existing cleanup transaction;
4. if quiescence/ownership is ambiguous, use the existing discard/quarantine/reprovision path rather than logical reuse;
5. never allow a retry/new task to inherit a Worker whose prior turn may still be active.

IMPLEMENTATION RULES
1. Replace DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS-as-fallback with null/no deadline for ordinary tasks.
2. Normalize explicit timeout only when the caller supplied a value.
3. When no deadline exists, await Promise-driven completion until terminal/cancel/recovery policy acts.
4. When deadline exists, race the wait against that deadline and then use the existing stop/cleanup transaction.
5. Keep MAX_TIMEOUT_MS or equivalent upper safety bound for explicit deadlines.
6. Preserve existing fail-closed cleanup/discard behavior; do not create a second lifecycle or ownership mechanism.

TESTS
1. task without timeoutMs can exceed the old default-equivalent fixture duration conceptually without being classified task-timeout (use a short deterministic test mechanism; do not actually wait minutes);
2. explicit timeout still produces task-timeout;
3. graph cancel while waiting produces cancelled, not task-timeout;
4. timeout path stops/cleans lease only after safe cleanup;
5. cancellation/deadline cannot make a still-active Worker available to another task;
6. ambiguous cleanup uses existing discard/fail-closed behavior rather than unsafe reuse;
7. retry semantics remain bounded and retries use fresh safe ownership;
8. status/public task representation reports null/explicit values correctly.

RUN
- node tests/dev-agent/dynamic-task-graph.mjs
- npm run dev-agent:test

DIFF CHECK
Only ALLOWED FILES may change.

STOP CONDITIONS
If removing the default timeout exposes a separate liveness problem, record it for Phase 5. Do not solve it in this card.
If quiescent cleanup cannot be preserved without changing Pool ownership semantics, stop and report the exact missing contract instead of weakening cleanup.

DELIVERY
Ready-to-merge PR, no merge. NEXT_CARD=F.
