## Review 1 — Architecture / Scope / Dependency Review

### Reviewed against

- `docs/HEX_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md` Phase 7/8/9 migration ordering;
- Master Architecture §18 decompiler pipeline/middle-end/structuring/pass-contract requirements;
- architecture/ABI/type/MemorySSA/alias invariants;
- `docs/MIGRATION_GUARDRAILS.md` semantic decompiler boundary.

### Findings

1. The first implementation guide covered the eight explicit Phase 8 migration deliverables but did not fully account for the broader mandatory mature middle-end inventory in Master Architecture §18.2.
2. Existing capabilities such as copy propagation-like behavior, MemorySSA reaching-store substitution, prototype recovery, variable coalescing, switch/loop recovery, and aggregate layout recovery needed an explicit **audit-before-reimplement** rule.
3. Prepared-baseline source still showed AAPCS64 assumptions in `types/prototype.js` and `types/high-variables.js`. Phase 8 planning needed a hard cross-architecture re-audit after Phase 5/6/7 rather than assuming those files would already be generic.
4. Phase 7 facts needed to be identified as upstream authority. The decompiler must not compensate for missing alias/effect/type/summary facts with private heuristics.
5. Phase 9 solver work needed an explicit boundary so Phase 8 would not accidentally expand into an SMT project.

### Corrections made

- Added a complete P8-0 readiness matrix covering the broader §18.2 middle-end inventory.
- Added explicit states: `PROVEN_EXISTING`, `PARTIAL_EXISTING`, `PHASE8_IMPLEMENT`, `UPSTREAM_BLOCKED`, `INTEGRATION_ONLY`, `NOT_REQUIRED_FOR_P8_EXIT`.
- Added live-main re-audit of ABI/prototype/high-variable architecture assumptions.
- Added the rule that missing upstream facts are repaired at their owner layer.
- Kept solver-backed verification in Phase 9 scope while preparing Phase 8 transform contracts for future stronger proof.

### Review 1 result

**PASS after correction.** Scope is now dependency-driven instead of feature-list-driven.

## Review 2 — Implementation / Failure Semantics / Correctness Review

### Reviewed against

- `js/decompiler/passes/manager.js`;
- `js/decompiler/pipeline-core.js`;
- `js/decompiler/pipeline.js`;
- `js/decompiler/rewrite/engine.js`;
- `js/decompiler/types/layout.js`;
- `js/decompiler/types/high-variables.js`;
- `js/decompiler/types/prototype.js`;
- existing Ghidra/compiler-truth verification path.

### Findings

1. Current `PassManager` uses a global deadline and may skip optional passes. Heavy Phase 8 fixed-point work therefore creates a real risk of **partial mutation becoming authoritative** unless publication semantics are strengthened.
2. Current pipeline is a flat ordered pass list. Phase 8 analyses have real dependencies and invalidation relationships that should not be represented only by incidental array order.
3. Current rewrite engine already has strong reusable properties: named phases, preconditions, proof records, deterministic structural keys, fixed-point limits, and multiple budgets. Creating a second rewrite framework would be unnecessary architecture drift.
4. Current MemorySSA reaching-store substitution demonstrates the correct memory-proof direction. GVN/CSE/DCE must consume MemorySSA/alias/effect proof, not duplicate address heuristics.
5. Phase 8 needed explicit analysis-preservation/invalidation rules for CFG, dominators, loop facts, SSA, MemorySSA, ranges, value numbers, types, summaries, and origin maps.
6. Budget/degraded output needed to remain a completeness state, not silently become equivalent to complete analysis.

### Corrections made

- Added a staged/atomic pass transaction contract.
- Prohibited decompiler-readability work from mutating canonical Semantic IR/SSA/MemorySSA in place.
- Added `consumes / preserves / invalidates` analysis declarations.
- Added deterministic safe-publication behavior for cancellation/deadline/exception paths.
- Added a staged pipeline model from canonical semantic facts through scalar optimization, memory optimization, loop facts, high-level recovery, structuring, providers, and rendering.
- Added explicit SCCP, wrapped-range, memory-GVN, effect-aware DCE, induction, structuring, aggregate, provider, provenance, invalidation, and browser-budget contracts.
- Added under-invalidation and over-invalidation as separate required regressions.

### Review 2 result

**PASS after correction.** The plan now defines what happens when a pass succeeds, skips, times out, cancels, changes control flow, or invalidates downstream facts.

## Review 3 — Execution / Integration / Release Review

### Reviewed against

- `docs/ENGINEERING_PROCESS_GUARDRAILS.md` phase preflight, candidate merge-tree proof, checkpoint transaction, verifier maturity, moving-main, generated-output, iOS/browser truth, and completion requirements;
- historical process failure classes from Phase 3/4/5;
- the revised Phase 8 execution blueprint;
- final branch diff against prepared `main`.

### Findings

1. The execution blueprint defined the dependency DAG and final release gate, but each P8 checkpoint still needed a single explicit contract for **inputs / deliverables / required proof / merge blockers / handoff**.
2. Without those contracts, implementers could still reinterpret “done” per lane and recreate late integration.
3. The plan needed a durable mapping from known historical process failures to Phase 8 prevention mechanisms.
4. The first-deterministic-divergence rule needed to be explicit for rolling-gate failures.
5. Final docs needed to remain planning-only and avoid claiming current Phase 8 infrastructure that does not exist yet.

### Corrections made

Added `PHASE8_CHECKPOINT_CONTRACTS.md` and `.ja.md` with explicit contracts for global start blockers, P8-0 through P8-7, and P8-I integration/cutover. Also added candidate merge-tree proof, checkpoint locking, generated-output ownership/synchronization, moving-main single-owner behavior, a process-failure recurrence map, first-divergence debugging, and exact hard-zero release gates.

The final branch diff remains docs-only. Proposed Phase 8 files/commands/infrastructure are explicitly labeled as proposals to be generated/revalidated at P8-0 rather than present-tense implementation claims.

### Review 3 result

**PASS after correction.** A future implementation owner can now determine when each checkpoint may start, what it owns, what evidence it must produce, what blocks merge, and exactly what it hands to the next dependency.

## Review 4 — Fast / Safe Critical-Path Review

### Goal

Optimize for **shortest safe completion time**, not additional theoretical completeness. The review asked which work can be removed, deferred, parallelized, or moved out of the inner development loop without weakening any normative merge/release gate.

### Reviewed against

- the complete Phase 8 planning set after Reviews 1–3;
- `ENGINEERING_PROCESS_GUARDRAILS.md` §§3.1–3.6, especially the mandatory preflight, candidate merge-tree proof, integration checkpoint lock, verifier maturity, and final cutover;
- historical EP-003/009/010/011/014/016 failure classes covering generated output, checkpoint ordering, moving main, verifier maturity, CI fanout, and algorithmic performance;
- the actual PR scope/size and operator reading burden.

### Findings

1. **No safety gate can legitimately be removed from candidate/integration boundaries.** Normative guardrails require candidate-tree rolling product + independent shadow proof and a post-merge checkpoint transaction on an exact head.
2. The planning set had become deliberately comprehensive, but its size created a new efficiency risk: an operator repeatedly reading all detailed documents would put documentation interpretation on the critical path.
3. The plan distinguished safe parallelism conceptually but did not provide a single operational rule for **what may be developed early versus what may be integrated early**.
4. The verification plan needed a clearer separation between fast inner-loop checks and mandatory exact-product boundary proof. Without that separation, implementers could waste time running full external differentials after every edit, or make the opposite mistake and reuse old local green evidence at integration.
5. Moving-main and generated-output rules were safe but needed to be framed explicitly as **centralized costs** so component lanes do not repeatedly pay them.
6. Failure triage needed a short operator path centered on the first deterministic divergence to prevent fixing downstream pseudocode symptoms.
7. Algorithm lanes needed minimum-success stopping rules to prevent scope creep (for example, building a global superoptimizer or an unnecessarily rich value domain before exit metrics require it).

### Corrections made

Added `docs/PHASE8_FAST_PATH.ja.md` as the normal operator entrypoint. It does not weaken or replace any detailed contract. It adds:

- a single shortest-safe critical path;
- a hard-gate list that must never be optimized away;
- P8-0/P8-1 stop conditions to prevent foundation/framework polishing from expanding indefinitely;
- safe prework parallelism for later lanes after P8-0;
- explicit distinction between parallel **development** and serialized checkpoint **acceptance**;
- three evidence tiers:
  - Tier A: owned inner-loop/adversarial tests;
  - Tier B: mandatory candidate merge-tree rolling + shadow proof;
  - Tier C: mandatory accepted-integration checkpoint proof;
- first-deterministic-divergence failure triage;
- minimum success conditions for P8-2 through P8-7 to prevent feature creep;
- algorithm-first performance optimization before CI topology changes;
- moving-main reconciliation centralized in the integration owner;
- committed generated-output synchronization centralized in the integration owner;
- a short operator checklist so detailed documents are opened only when a checkpoint/design decision requires them.

### Review 4 result

**PASS after correction.** The plan now distinguishes correctness gates from avoidable repeated work. The safe gates remain unchanged, while the expected implementation path removes repeated full-doc reading, unnecessary full-product test reruns during editing, per-component moving-main churn, per-component committed generated synchronization, downstream symptom debugging, and premature optimizer/framework scope growth.

# Final review conclusion

No unresolved architecture/process contradiction was found in the planning set against the prepared baseline after four correction passes.

The remaining unknowns are deliberately future-sensitive and must be resolved from live evidence at P8-0:

- actual `main` SHA when Phase 8 begins;
- exact Phase 6 and Phase 7 completion state;
- then-current decompiler/ABI architecture debt;
- actual Phase 8 ownership paths;
- exact mandatory corpus/toolchain availability;
- exact generated-output/build relationship;
- exact baseline quality/performance numbers;
- exact verifier/workflow identities.

Those are **not gaps to guess now**. The planning docs turn each one into a mandatory P8-0 observation/gate.

For normal execution, start with `PHASE8_FAST_PATH.ja.md`, then open only the current checkpoint contract and the relevant detailed algorithm section. This keeps the safety model intact without putting the planning corpus itself on the critical path.

The Phase 8 planning set is ready for pre-implementation merge as documentation, without claiming that Phase 8 itself has started or passed any production exit gate.
